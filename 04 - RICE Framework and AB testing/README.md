<p align="center">
  🌟 This project is split into 2 parts, the first part is about prioritizing hypotheses by giving a grade to different aspects of it; "reach", "impact", "confidence" and "effort", thus why we name it R.I.C.E.<br>

  The second part goes around a typical analysis, cleaning and spotting data errors, EDA, general visualizations and hypothesis testing. We're given 2 datasets: "orders" and "visits".
