<h1 align="center">🚀 Callcenter operators analysis </h1>

<p align="center">
  🌟 This is considered the final project for TripleTen's bootcamp. You need to conduct the analysis from scratch, first of all, you need to think about the path you want to take, the questions you want to answer and how you want to do it. Then you get into the data. We only have 2 datasets; "calls" and "clients".
  The main question you want to answer is; which of these operators could be considered inefficient if we have a certain model of what a good operator is.
