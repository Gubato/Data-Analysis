There's one dataset missing, because of its size (90 mb)

Throughout this project, I start to create and rely my analysis on graphs and visualizations. This skill is key in order to present my conclusions and my discoveries to any person that wants to know more about this case.

This was also a great example of how sometimes there's some data that gets collected but it can contain bugs, such as some purchases happening in non active hours. It is important to acknowledge this whenever we're trying to find outliers and anomalies in our daily analysis.
